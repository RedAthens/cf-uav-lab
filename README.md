This repo is based on several repoisties: https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy, https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials and https://github.com/ros-drivers/mocap_optitrack.
With the MATLAB and ROS, I established a solution for a single adrone and multi ardrone flight using the motion capture ,optitrack.
